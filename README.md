# Camera Slider with ability the to Pan.
This project is intended to get myself familiar with GitHub, as we're moving to this at work.  
Also, I've got a project on the go to build a camera slider for timelapse photography and thought as an extra challenge I'd add a pan motion to the camera as it slides.
I'm hoping to create the pan speed such that it can take long exposure night images.  
I'll orient the track and angle it such that I'll be creating an oddball barndoor equatorial mount.  

Time will tell if I'm being too ambitious.
